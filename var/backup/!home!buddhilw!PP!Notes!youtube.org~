 @Mohammed  That would be USA with latin america, east, west and south africa, and parts of oceania. To cite names, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand etc.

Now, in comparison to the USA, China has two Special Administrative Regions: Macau and Hong Kong. That means, they are politically free, but economically attached to China. No other country in the world has such working agreements - not the USA for sure. The only thing they know of is Search and Destroy, like Metallica.

Also, you may be referring to BILATERAL agreements to industrialization made by China. More or less in the lines of, we build and land the engineers to you, but then we can use to transport our goods. That's in accord with both countries. On the other hand, in ~1920-1950 USA and some European countries made the Washinton Consensus: we agree to what should and will be done in South America, in terms of Industrialization. Of course, no South American country actually participated in this "consensus". THATs very different.

I rest my case.

Cite names, Mohammed. I can; do you?
