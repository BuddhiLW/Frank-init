** Pre-historic origins
- Fossilised remains of Homo erectus, popularly known as the "Java Man",
suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to
500,000 years ago.

- Homo sapiens reached the region around 43,000 BCE.

- Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan. They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they spread east.

** Independence
- [WWII] The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during World
  War II ended Dutch rule and encouraged the previously suppressed
  independence movement.
  
- Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, Sukarno and
Mohammad Hatta, influential nationalist leaders, proclaimed Indonesian
independence and were appointed president and vice-president
respectively.


** Current economy
- Relatively steady inflation (2000-) and an increase in GDP deflator and
the Consumer Price Index have contributed to strong economic
growth in recent years.

- From 2007 to 2019, annual growth has accelerated to between 4% and 6%
as a result of improvement in the banking sector and domestic
consumption, helping Indonesia weather the 2008–2009 Great Recession;

- Regain in 2011 the investment grade rating it had lost in 1997. As
  of 2019, 9.41% of the population lived below the poverty line, and
  the official open unemployment rate was 5.28%.

  - However, in late 2020, Indonesia fell into its first recession in
    22 years due to the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
