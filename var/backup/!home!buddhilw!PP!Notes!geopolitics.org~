It's not a feature. It happens because of geopolitics. And, it's not me who aint applying methods of science; I didn't invent the north american treaty "Washinton Consensus" who dictate under what conditions the south american industrialization would happen. Note that, it was done without ours consensus,. 

How do we move from that to The. Methods. Of. Science.? Who can do that. Point me people, names, institutions etc. 

All you are doing me is to give empty words. No physical tangible manifestation of your idealization.

I will cite things that are not features of current economics, but they happened BECAUSE of usa hegemony, ok? 

1) "Nicaragua pacification" (1912-1913); actually, USA has hegemony and have geopolitically forced into Nicaragua, since 1853, till (present https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/travel/arts-culture/united-states-intervention-in-nicaragua/) .

2) Washington Consensus for South America: Argentina, Venezuela
