* After Fresh Install of Anaconda
After a fresh installation of Anaconda Distribution (either 2 or 3), following steps should be performed to achieve the desired kernels (R & Julia) on your notebook.
To install R on Anaconda(2/3) Jupyter Notebook :

** R
 - Open 'Anaconda Command Prompt' & execute =conda update notebook= to
 update your Jupyter notebook to the most recent version.

 - Then install IRkernel by =conda install -c r notebook r-irkernel=

 - Now you may open *R* in your command prompt by running R.exe
 Install all necessary *R* packages using the following lines in the R
 console by executing :

 #+begin_src shell
 install.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'evaluate', 'crayon', 'pbdZMQ', 
 'devtools', 'uuid', 'digest'))
 #+end_src

 #+begin_src shell
   devtools::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel')
 #+end_src

 Finally, make the R kernel available to your Jupyter Notebook by executing:

 Install only for the current user
 - =IRkernel::installspec()=

 For System-wide installation(all Users)
 - =IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)=

** Julia
To install Julia on Anaconda(2/3) Jupyter Notebook :

- First, download Julia version 0.4 or later and run the installer. Then
run the Julia application (double-click on it); the Julia Console with
a julia> prompt will appear.

- Now, for the most important step, open 'Anaconda Command Prompt' &
execute =where jupyter= to see the actual path of your Jupyter
Notebook. The output will be something like
"C:\Users\JohnDoe\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda3\bin\jupyter.exe"

- Copy the above location and go to your Julia console. Now, execute the
following respectively:
#+begin_src shell
  ENV["JUPYTER"]="C:\\Users\\JohnDoe\\AppData\\Local\\Continuum\\Anaconda3\\bin\\jupyter.exe"
#+end_src

- =Pkg.add("IJulia")=

- =Pkg.build("IJulia") (Optional, execute if further error occurs again.)=

â¬† Notice that the backslashes have to be doubled when you type them as
a Julia string. I've just assumed that the path is your Anaconda path
with \bin\jupyter appended, but replace that with whatever where
jupyter tells you.


After few minutes, in Julia console execute:

- using IJulia
- notebook()

Now, you can program Julia in your Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.
